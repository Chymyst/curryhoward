# Quotation

_These are all interesting examples, but is there a practical side to Curry-Howard isomorphism? Probably not in everyday programming._ -- Bartosz Milewski (2015), [Category Theory for Programmers, Chapter 9: Function types.](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2015/03/13/function-types/)

The `curryhoward` library aims to use the Curry-Howard isomorphism as a tool for practical applications.

# curryhoward

This is a library for automatic implementation of Scala expressions via the Curry-Howard isomorphism.

The Curry-Howard isomorphism maps functions with fully parametric types to theorems in the intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL) with universally quantified propositions.

For example, the type of the function

```scala
def f[X, Y]: X ⇒ Y ⇒ X = (x: X) ⇒ (y: Y) ⇒ x

```

is mapped to the propositional theorem `∀ X : ∀ Y : X ⇒ (Y ⇒ X)` in the IPL.

The `curryhoward` library provides Scala macros that generate code automatically for any such function, based on the function's required type signature:

```scala
def f[X, Y]: X ⇒ Y ⇒ X = implement

```

The code is generated by the `implement` macro at compile time.

A compile-time error occurs when there are several inequivalent implementations for a given type, or if the type cannot be implemented at all (i.e. when the given propositional formula is not a theorem).

See the [youtube presentation](https://youtu.be/cESdgot_ZxY) and the [tutorial](docs/Tutorial.md) for more details.

# Usage

There are two main functions, `implement` and `ofType`.

The function `implement` works when defining methods, and is used as a replacement for the method's code:

```scala
import io.chymyst.ch.implement

def f[X, Y]: X ⇒ Y ⇒ X = implement

// The fully polymorphic code `(x: X) ⇒ (y: Y) ⇒ x` is generated for the function `f`.
  
f(123)("abc") // returns 123

// The applicative `map2` function for the Reader monad.
def map2[E, A, B, C](readerA: E ⇒ A, readerB: E ⇒ B, f: A ⇒ B ⇒ C): E ⇒ C = implement
// Generates the code (e: E) ⇒ f(readerA(e), readerB(e)) 

```

The function `ofType` is designed for generating expressions using previously computed values:

```scala
import io.chymyst.ch.ofType

case class User(name: String, id: Long)

val x: Int = 123
val s: String = "abc"
val f: Int ⇒ Long = _.toLong // whatever

val user = ofType[User](f, s, x)
// Generates the expression User(s, f(x)) from previously computed values f, s, x

```

The generated code is purely functional and assumes that all given values and types are free of side effects.

# How it works

The macros examine the given type expression via reflection (at compile time).
The type expression is rewritten as a formula of IPL and passed on to the theorem prover.
The theorem prover performs an exhaustive proof search to look for all possible lambda-terms that implement the given type.
After that, the terms are simplified, so that equivalent terms that are different only by alpha-conversion, beta-conversion, or eta-conversion are eliminated.
Finally, the terms are measured according to their "information loss score", and sorted so that the terms with the least information loss are returned (and all other alternative terms ignored).
The Scala macro then converts the lambda-terms into Scala code.
All this happens at compile time, so compilation may take longer if a lot of terms are being generated.

It is also possible to use some given expressions with known types.

For example, if required to implement a type `Option[B]` given value `x` of type `Option[A]` and value `f` of type `A ⇒ Option[B]`, the library will first rewrite the problem as that of implementing a function type `Option[A] ⇒ (A ⇒ Option[B]) ⇒ Option[B]` with type parameters `A` and `B`.
Having obtained a solution, i.e. a term of that type, the library will then apply this term to arguments `x` and `f`.
The resulting term will be returned as Scala code that uses the given values `x` and `f`.

The current implementation uses an IPL theorem prover based on the sequent calculus called LJT as presented in:

[D. Galmiche, D. Larchey-Wendling. _Formulae-as-Resources Management for an Intuitionistic Theorem Prover_ (1998)](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.35.2618). 	In 5th Workshop on Logic, Language, Information and Computation, WoLLIC'98, Sao Paulo.

Some changes were made to the order of LJT rules, and some trivial additional rules implemented, so that `curryhoward` can generate all possible implementations rather than just some, and also to support case classes (i.e. named conjunctions).

The original presentation of LJT is found in:

[R. Dyckhoff, _Contraction-Free Sequent Calculi for Intuitionistic Logic_, The Journal of Symbolic Logic, Vol. 57, No. 3, (Sep., 1992), pp. 795-807](https://rd.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/publications/jsl57.pdf).

# Unit tests

`sbt test`

# Status

- The theorem prover for the full IPL is working
- When a type cannot be implemented, signal a compile-time error
- Debugging options are available
- Support for `Unit` type, constant types, type parameters, function types, tuples, sealed traits / case classes / case objects
- Both conventional Scala syntax `def f[T](x: T): T` and curried syntax `def f[T]: T ⇒ T` can be used
- Java-style argument groups can be used, e.g. `A => (B, C) => D`, which is not the same as using a tuple type: `A => ((B, C)) => D`
- When a type can be implemented in more than one way, heuristics ("least information loss") are used to prefer implementations that are more likely to satisfy algebraic laws
- Signal error when a type can be implemented in more than one way despite using heuristics
- Tests and a tutorial

# To-do items

- generate a custom subclass of `Function1` that also carries symbolic information about the lambda-term
- add an API that exposes the `TermExpr` structures generated from type
- add facilities to reason about terms at run time (e.g. check the laws) using `TermExpr` structures

# Known bugs

- Limited support for recursive case classes (including `List`): generated code may fail and, in particular, cannot contain recursive functions. Example that fails to generate sensible code: `T => List[T]` (the generated code always returns empty list)

# Examples of working functionality

The following code examples show how various functions are implemented automatically, given their type.

```scala
// "Weak" Peirce's law:
def f[A, B]: ((((A ⇒ B) ⇒ A) ⇒ A) ⇒ B) ⇒ B = implement

// "Weak" law of _tertium non datur_:
def f[A, B]: (Either[A, A ⇒ B] ⇒ B) ⇒ B = implement

```

Automatic implementations of `pure`, `map`, and `flatMap` for the `Reader` monad:

```scala
def pure[E, A]: A ⇒ (E ⇒ A) = implement
def map[E, A, B]: (E ⇒ A) ⇒ (A ⇒ B) ⇒ (E ⇒ B) = implement
def flatMap[E, A, B]: (E ⇒ A) ⇒ (A ⇒ E ⇒ B) ⇒ (E ⇒ B) = implement

```

Constant types are treated as type parameters.

```scala

def f[A, B]: A ⇒ Int ⇒ (A, Int) = implement

f("abc")(123) // returns the tuple ("abc", 123)

```

Tuples, sealed traits, and case classes/case objects are supported, including `Option` and `Either`:

```scala
def eitherCommut[A, B]: Either[A, B] ⇒ Either[B, A] = implement

def eitherAssoc[A, B, C]: Either[A, Either[B, C]] ⇒ Either[Either[A, B], C] = implement

```

Case objects (and case classes with zero-argument constructors) are treated as named versions of the `Unit` type.

## Supported syntax

There are three ways in which code can be generated based on a given type:

1. `def f[...](...): ... = implement` -- the type and extra values are specified on the left-hand side 
2. `ofType[...](...)` -- the type and extra values are specified within an expression
3. `allOfType[...](...)` -- similar to `ofType[...](...)`, except that now all inequivalent implementations are returned 

```scala
import io.chymyst.ch._

// Conventional Scala syntax for functions.
def f1[T, U](x: T, y: T ⇒ U) : (T, U) = implement

// Fully or partially curried functions are supported.
def f2[T, U](x: T): (T ⇒ U) ⇒ (T, U) = implement

def f3[T, U]: T ⇒ (T ⇒ U) ⇒ (T, U) = implement

// Generating code within expressions.
case class User(name: String, id: Long)

val f: Int ⇒ Long = _.toLong

ofType[User](123, "abc", f).id // This expression evaluates to `123L`.

```

## Heuristics for choosing different implementations

If the theorem prover finds several alternative implementations of a type, it attempts to find the implementation with the smallest "information loss".

The "information loss" of a term is defined as an integer number being the sum of:

- the number of (curried) arguments that are ignored by some function,
- the number of tuple parts that are computed but subsequently not used,
- the number of `case` clauses that do not use their arguments,
- the number of disjunction or conjunction parts that are inserted out of order,
- the number of times an input value is used (if more than once).

Choosing the smallest "information loss" is a heuristic that enables automatic choice of the correct implementations for a large number of cases (but, of course, not in all cases).

For example, here are correct implementations of `pure`, `map`, and `flatMap` for the `State` monad:

```scala
def pure[S, A]: A ⇒ (S ⇒ (A, S)) = implement
def map[S, A, B]: (S ⇒ (A, S)) ⇒ (A ⇒ B) ⇒ (S ⇒ (B, S)) = implement
def flatMap[S, A, B]: (S ⇒ (A, S)) ⇒ (A ⇒ S ⇒ (B, S)) ⇒ (S ⇒ (B, S)) = implement

```

Note that there are several inequivalent implementations for the State monad's `map` and `flatMap`,
but only one of them loses no information -- and thus has a higher chance of satisfying the correct laws.

The theorem prover does not check any equational laws.
It selects the terms with the smallest level of information loss, in hopes that there will be only one term selected,
and that it will be the desired term that satisfies equational laws of whatever sort the users expect. 

The theorem prover will generate a (compile-time) error when there are two or more implementations with the smallest level of information loss.

If there are several possible implementations but only one implementation with the smallest level of information loss,
the theorem prover will choose that implementation but print a warning message such as

```
Warning:scalac: type (S → (A, S)) → (A → B) → S → (B, S) has 2 implementations (laws need checking?)

```

This message means that the resulting implementation is _probably_ the right one, but there was a choice to be made.
If there exist some equational laws that apply to this function, the laws need to be checked by the user (e.g. in unit tests).

In some cases, there are several inequivalent implementations that all have the same level of "information loss."
The function `allOfType` returns all these implementations.

### Examples of heuristic choice

The "smallest information loss" heuristic allows us to select the "better" implementation in the following example:

```scala
def optionId[X]: Option[X] ⇒ Option[X] = implement

optionId(Some(123)) == 123
optionId(None) == None

```

There are two possible implementations of the type `Option[X] ⇒ Option[X]`: the "trivial" implementation (always returns `None`), and the "interesting" implementation (returns the same value as given).
The "trivial" implementation is rejected by the algorithm because it ignores the information given in the original data, so it has higher "information loss".

Another heuristic is to prefer implementations that use more parts of a disjunction.
This avoids implementations that e.g. always generate the `Some` subtype of `Option` and never generate `None`.

Another heuristic is to prefer implementations that preserve the order of parts in conjunctions and disjunctions.

For example,

```scala
def f[X]: ((X, X, X)) ⇒ (X, X, X) = implement

```

will generate the code for the identity function on triples, that is, `((a, b, c)) ⇒  (a, b, c)`.
There are many other implementations of this type, for example `((a, b, c)) ⇒  (b, c, a)`.
However, these implementations do not preserve the order of the elements in the input data, which is considered as a "loss of information".

The analogous parts-ordering heuristic is used for disjunctions, which selects the most reasonable implementation of

```scala
def f[X]: Either[X, X] ⇒ Either[X, X] = implement

```
